# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Stay beside Earth project.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. What temperature anomalies can be predictable?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
temperature anomaly is an important problem, because with diagnositing and predicting temperature anomalies, we can find the consequences of climate change and its negative impact in our lives and prevent damages our Earth. This projects analyzes temperature anomalies, using method perdictions. The results can give insights into some visulization graphic output. This extends the the geographical coverage by estimating temperature anomalies further from the available measurements. This improves the representation of less well observed regions in our estimates of global and hemispheric temperature change.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
My frist data sourrse Datasource1 is HadCRUT is a global temperature dataset, providing gridded temperature anomalies across the world as well as averages for the hemispheres and the globe as a whole. CRUTEM and HadSST are temperature datasets for the land and ocean regions, respectively, and contribute to the global dataset.


### Datasource1: ExampleSource
* Metadata URL: https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data//temperature/#datdow
* Data URL: https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data//temperature/HadCRUT.5.0.2.0.analysis.anomalies.ensemble_mean.nc
* Data Type: netCDF

For land regions of the world, timeseries of monthly-mean temperatures were compiled from over 10,000 weather stations for consideration in CRUTEM5.0. Of these, almost 8,000 were actually used to produce the gridded CRUTEM5.0 dataset while the remainder were not used because they did not have sufficient data to estimate a 1961-1990 mean (or "normal"). Coverage is denser over the more populated parts of the world, particularly, the United States, southern Canada, Europe and Japan. Coverage is sparsest over the interior of the South American and African continents and over Antarctica. The number of available stations was small during the 1850s, but increases to over 2,000 stations by 1900 and more than 5,000 stations during most of the 1951-2010 period (see Fig. 8 of Osborn et al., 2021).
These datasets are made available under the Open Government Licence.

## Work Packages

<!-- List of work packages ordered sequentially, each pointing to an issue with more details. -->

1. What data is available? What errors are there?
2. What limitations present themselves, is data missing and representative?
3. What data types are relevant, do you need to research anything?
