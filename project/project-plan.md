# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Climate change MADE project.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Has changes in Black carbon made any impact on DMPS Particle Concentration or not?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
there datasets are related to Measurements of equivalent black carbon and Measurements of particle number concentration in Ispra, Italy on 2021. These are published by European Commission, Joint Research Centre and are related to atmospheric measurements for emission gasses which can impact each other. With these information we can find out incressing in one of them can have impact on the other or not.


## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
Datasource1 is for Measurements of particle number concentration in Ispra, Italy on 2021.
Datasource2 is for Measurements of equivalent black carbon in Ispra, Italy on 2021.
these datasets have been downloaded then they are extracted. 
adding metadata and clarify its datatypes then comparison between their measurements based on timeline and for the last part it loaded on sqlite database.

## Work Packages

<!-- List of work packages ordered sequentially, each pointing to an issue with more details. -->

1. What data is available? What errors are there?
2. What limitations present themselves, is data missing and representative?
3. What data types are relevant, do you need to research anything?
